# Stock-Anomaly-Detection-with-Modular-Neural-Network
In this project, I aimed to detect the outliers of National Stock Exchange data. 98% accuracy is obtained at the end of my experiments.
main.py must run in order to see the result. 
I have shown clearly the evaluted work with screenshots. 
In this project, data is normalized, encoded then integrated to neural network.
I am open to any feedback.
